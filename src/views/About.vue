        <h1>A little about me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a full-time developer living in a town called NÃ¦stved in Denmark.
I am currently in a position at Webto ApS as Frontend Developer
Where I work with WordPress and TYPO3 websites
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I trained as a Web Integrator back in 2012 at Roskilde Tekniske Skole,
between pronunciation and after graduation, I have worked in various Startups and worked as a developer in a few different TYPO3 agencies over the last 5 - 6 years
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I have previously worked with frameworks such as Laravel and PHPUnit,
when I worked as a Software & Test Engineer at Athliit ApS which is now Sportyfriends.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          With some experience with backend development and working with databases, I have found out that my desire is to carry out more frontend development and web design tasks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          When I get time for myself, I spend time being a gamer, taking care of family life and trying and practicing my old lifestyle as a skateboarder, which I have practiced for 12-13 years of my life.
